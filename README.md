#Tenzies Dice: A Simple Game of Chance
Tenzies Dice is a fun, quick-paced game where your goal is to roll ten dice until all of them show the same number. This number can be any number from 1 to 6.

How to Play:
* Start the Game: Click the "Roll Dice" button to get your initial set of ten dice.
* Identify a Target Number: Choose one of the dice to be your target number by click on it to freeze it.
* Roll and Keep: Roll the dice again. If any dice show your target number, click on it. You can keep as many or as few as you like.
* Reroll the Rest: Roll the remaining dice that didn't show your target number.
* Repeat Until All Match: Continue rolling and freezing dice until all ten dice show your target number.
* Scoring: Each roll costs you one point. The fewer rolls it takes to get all ten dice matching, the higher your score.

Once you've achieved all ten dice matching your target number, you've won a round! 
You can then start a new round and try to beat your previous score.
